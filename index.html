        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Gustavo Jimenez. I only found out about coding maybe 1 year ago. If you showed me code then I wouldn't have a clue what that was and probably thought you were crazy. The reason I joined geekwise was because my friend Kevin said you wanna come to the office I'm signing up for a class. I said sure and went. When we were there he told me about and suggested that I join the class to. Before that my dad was talking to me about how I should get a job that revolves around technology and to start taking those type of classes, so that was another reason I said I would join Geekwise.  I live in a couple of areas making it a bit difficult to track me down. I like playing video games some of my favorites are Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas, and State of Decay. There isn't a whole bunch to know got nothing better to do.

        <h1>My Teachers</h1>
        <ul>
          <div class="none">
            <li>Climate Amante</li>
            <div>
              <img src="img/Climate.jpg"/>
              <p>
                This was my very first teacher for coding. Climate was cool he pushed us to our limits in his class if it wasn't for that I wouldn't know any code. We could always picture him being the final boss of a video game on top of a mountain.

            <li>Ken Koontz aka Father Ken</li>
            <div>
              <img src="img/Ken.jpg">
              <p>
                Ken was my second teacher for coding he taught us javascript the second half of my first year of Geekwise. He was really chill he helped me and my friends start the MEMIT project.

            <div>
              <img src="img/Matt.jpg">
              <p>
                Matt was my third teacher he helped me understand more of the fundamentals of css and finally learning flexbox making everything so much easier to code.
